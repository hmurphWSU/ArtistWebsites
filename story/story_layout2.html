             <img src = "images/sour.jpg" alt = "Sour Album" />
             <p> As touched on in the background section, Rodrigo's music was influenced by her parent's music choice and country music. At the time,
                 one of those country singers she followed was Taylor Swift, who she has said has influenced her music specifically. During 2020, she
                 signed with Interscope Records and Geffen Records, and then released her debut song drivers license in January 2021 that broke Spotify's
                 record of most daily streams of a non-holiday song twice. After drivers license, Rodrigo released deja vu, and good 4 u, neither of which
                 quite reached the heights of drivers license, but good 4 u did come close. After those 3 songs, Rodrigo released the Sour album in May
                 of 2021, which topped the charts in the US, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK. 
                 The album features these songs: </p>

                <h1> Background Info </h1>
               <img src = "images/california.png" alt = "Murrieta California" />
               <p> Olivia Rodrigo was born on February 20, 2003 in Murrieta California, although she lived and grew up in a the nearby city of Temecula.
                   She is biracial, with her parents coming from the Phillipines and having German and Irish ancestry. Although Rodrigo's parents aren't
                   really involved in the acting or music, she has been working toward her career for most of her life. She began vocal lessons in
                   kindergarten and learned to play piano. At the age of six, she began taking acting and singing lessons all while being influenced
                   by her parent's music choice of alternative rock music, and her own liking of country music. </p>

             <img src = "images/driverslicense.jpeg" alt = "Drivers License" />
             <p> My personal connection with Olivia Rodrigo stems back to late 2020 to early 2021. At the time, I was watching this one channel in 
                 particular who does all kinds of music videos and all over YouTube I kept seeing stuff about this new song called drivers license.
                 I figured it was probably another song that was super popular that I wouldn't like, but the music channel I watched put out a
                 video about the song so I figured I would give it a try. After watching the video, I decided I liked the song quite a bit and
                 listened to it until the Sour album came out in May of 2021. Although I haven't and probably won't watch Bizaardvark, I have
                 watched the first season of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and I thought it was pretty good. </p>

             <p> Early on in her career, throughout the years 2015 and 2019, Rodrigo had a few different acting roles. Chronologically, she
                 first did an Old Navy commerical, then played the lead role of Grace Thomas in the film An American Girl: Grace Stirs up Success,
                 and then she has played two different roles which I would say are her main roles, hence the images. The first big role comes in
                 form of playing Paige Olvera in Bizaardvark, which, interestingly also features YouTuber and boxer Jake Paul, and finally, she
                 plays the role of Nini in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series which is also where one of her bigger songs, All I Want, 
                 comes from. </p>
